# SuperMegaUltra LLM AI - The Most Overbuilt 90s-Inspired Landing Page Ever

Congratulations! You have just stumbled upon the single greatest AI landing page in the history of the internet. Built with **Next.js**, this masterpiece perfectly balances **cutting-edge web technology** with the **aesthetic crimes** of the 1990s.

## Features (Yes, I'm Serious)
- **Marquee Madness** - Because nothing says "innovation" like text scrolling endlessly across the screen.
- **Blinking Text** - Scientifically proven to increase engagement (and migraines) by 300%.
- **Overengineered Fonts** - Why settle for one Google font when you can load three and achieve peak **Comic Sans synergy**?
- **Obnoxious Color Palette** - A design so bold it burns retinas at any resolution.
- **Visitor Counter** - For that authentic GeoCities street cred. (*Numbers not guaranteed to be accurate.)
- **Hot Links!!!** - Because every good 90s site needs a **"CLICK HERE OR ELSE!"** section.
- **Hardcoded AI Hype** - With claims so bold, they make snake oil salesmen jealous.

## Why Next.js? 
Because I could. And because overcomplicating a static landing page with server-side rendering, image optimization, and API routes makes it **feel** more impressive. Also, why not?

## How to Run This Technological Marvel

1. Clone this **game-changing** repository

2. Install dependencies (this will take longer than it should because I overbuilt this for no reason):

   pnpm install
   ```

3. Run the dev server (brace yourself):
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and prepare to be amazed.
